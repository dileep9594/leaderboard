# leaderboard
In this project i am going to build a project using java spring boot and mongodb which will calculate the leader board based on the user activity 

# Objective:
1. Build a leaderboard system that tracks user activities in a game and calculates scores based on those activities.
2. Users should be able to view their own scores as well as the top scores on the leaderboard.
# Functional Requirements:
1. Users can register/login to the system.
2. Users can perform various activities in the game, such as completing levels, earning achievements, etc.
3. Each activity has a predefined score associated with it.
4. The system calculates scores for users based on their activities.
5. Users can view their own scores and rankings on the leaderboard.
6. Users can view the top scores and rankings on the leaderboard.
# Non-functional Requirements:
1. The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users and activities.
2. The system should be secure to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
3. The system should be efficient in calculating scores and updating the leaderboard.
# Assumptions:
We'll assume a simplified scenario where users have unique IDs and activities are limited to a few types (e.g., completing levels, earning achievements).
